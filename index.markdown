## GETTING STARTED

I'm an automation and manual tester. As a manual tester I am as sensitive in detecting functional mishaps, as I am in targeting user experience weaknesses. I always try to keep as holistic perspective on the product as possible. As an automation tester I feel best in BDD that lets my test blend in development process and positively impact customers satisfaction.
